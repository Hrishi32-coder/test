/*

Make sure that identical transactions sent in quick succession don't overcome contract's built-in limits

For example, make sure that trying to double-claim from a round by sending two simultaenous transactions
WITHOUT nonce is not going to work

v Make sure that contracts really can not call our predictions contract

Drill user_BetBull & user_BetBear with stack overflow(more than 1024 deep) to try and get it to only execute partially
for example, it might be possible to keep on calling "HandleReferrals", while making transaction fail afterwards
